### 1. Description

> This "assistant" is a plug-in for Android Studio, which is equivalent to a small helper when you use this library. It only helps you generate some AOP code, and has no effect on your code.

The plug-in generates AOP auxiliary code for the target class, including the following functions:

- @AndroidAopReplaceClass
- @AndroidAopMatchClassMethod
- @AndroidAopModifyExtendsClass
- @AndroidAopCollectMethod

Although there is such a plug-in, you also need to understand how to use this library to identify and select the generated code, and don't copy it blindly~

### 2. Install the plug-in

- [Plugin Market](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25179-androidaop-code-viewer), search for the plug-in **AndroidAOP Code Viewer** in Android Studio and install it

### 4. Special instructions

- The generated `@AndroidAopReplaceClass`, `@AndroidAopReplaceMethod` and The class name and function signature in the `@AndroidAopMatchClassMethod` code are absolutely correct ([Please correct me if you have any questions](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/AndroidAOP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=%E6%8F%90%E4%BA%A4%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84bug.md&title=)).
- The generated `@AndroidAopReplaceMethod` Java method does not include the suspend function of the Kotlin source code
- The generated `@AndroidAopReplaceMethod` method may have some deviations, so you need to compare it yourself. For example: `nullable?`, `Is it the type of Kotlin source code`, `variable parameter type becomes array type`, etc., these cannot be guaranteed to be accurately copied
